	  It's 1989 &mdash; the aptly named and recently established venue in Newtown embraces
	  not only a simple activity, but harbours the long lost culture of hanging out
	  in a CRT lit room with your buddies playing hit arcade games.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The immense popularity and growth of the venue seems to not solely owe its
	  thanks to large selection of 80's classics such as Pacman and Contra, but also
	  the inherent nostalgia factor.  One avid arcade-gamer, David, succinctly described
	  the '1989' experience as "Nostalgia! This place is great. The video games! The
	  board games! The music! A good crowd as well. [...] the atmosphere is a winner".

	  Let's face it, Gaming Arcades are now a relic of the past that gamers now flock
	  to for the unique atmosphere they offer in this new digital landscape. With
	  home gaming consoles striding forth in technological advancements over the decades,
	  the previous coin-driven, two meter tall counterparts were now seen as an inferior
	  gaming experience, to superior game devices that now even fit in your pocket.

	  To suggest to an Arcade-goer in the 1980s that they one day they could play a game
	  of Mortal Kombat against their friend in Vietnam, you may have received a look of
	  raised eyebrows and bemusement. After all, arcades were the place where social gaming
	  first truly flourished. Home consoles brought multiplayer digital gameplay into the household,
	  with some of the earliest cases being Xbox Live and the PSN (PlayStation Network) For better
	  or worse, the typical gamer can play in physical isolation but still be immersed within some
	  of the most social affordances that gaming has seen since the arcade.

	  As the name suggests, the 1989 Arcade Bar &amp; Kitchen, places a lot of focus on good food and
	  a variety of drinks, however, it isn't the food that patrons go for, but instead a long lost
	  experience, fuelled by nostalgia, and satisfied by classic arcade gaming.
