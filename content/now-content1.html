	As the Internet has become ubiquitous in the lives of many, we may now find ourselves in an
	'always-online' state with our smartphones, wi-fi enabled notebooks and the digital games we
	play. Whilst it is understandable that some games such as
	<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dota_2">Dota 2</a> with its online centric
	gameplay may require a constant Internet connection, there are often others such as
	<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_III">Diablo 3</a> and
	many mobile games that require Internet connectivity with no clear benefit	to the player.

      "Error 37" would <a target="_blank" href="http://au.ign.com/articles/2012/05/16/diablo-3s-best-error-37-jokes">achieve meme status</a>
      as overloaded servers prevented players from playing the single player campaign upon launch

  <p>
    To step back for a moment, an always-online game can offer many supposed features to benefit
    the player such as patch rollouts,
    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtransaction">microtransactions</a>,
    social connectivity and additional
    content. However, developers (especially larger ones) have realised an opportunity to embed
    the 'Always-on <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">DRM</a>'
    feature into popular games which are primarily there to prevent digital
    piracy. The earliest versions of <a target="_blank" href="http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/d3/">Diablo 3</a>
    and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_(2013_video_game)">SimCity (2013)</a>
    were both notable examples of
    always-on DRM, facing the wrath of furious gamers who were unhappy with this new direction
    that developers were taking. Frustrated gamers stated that requiring these popular games to
    be always-online ruined their experiences with the games for reasons such as the instability
    of the game's servers during peak periods, and furthermore, the fact that these games cannot
    be played with the absence of an Internet connection.

  <p>
    Whilst the Internet clearly offers benefits to gamers when it is correctly augmented into
    digital games, we may need to look closer into including it in a way that doesn't impede
    the experience of the gamer.
