    By now we are well familiar with implantable technology as inventions such as the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_cardiac_pacemaker">cardiac pacemaker</a>
    have been around, and saving lives since the 1960s. Recently, sci-fi titles such as
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kq5KWLqUewc">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a>
    have popularized and painted an awe-inspiring picture of what a world with
    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_enhancement">'human augmentation'</a>
    would look like regarding physical enhancements to the body.
  </p>
 
  <p>
    The <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror">Black Mirror</a> series
    portrays a much grimmer reality of technological implants in the episode
    '<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/10/black-mirror-playtest-review-season-three-netflix/504893/">Playtest</a>',
    where the protagonist takes part in an experiment, accepting a neural implant to alter his
    perceived real-world senses into an augmented reality video game. The barriers between the
    game and the real-world are completely blurred into one reality, and the protagonist was
    subjected to a horrific experience crafted from his greatest fears.
  </p>
 
  <p>
    As of recently, these fictional scenarios have come closer to being a reality with
    the collaboration of <a target="_blank" href="https://community.arm.com/">Arm</a> and
    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Sensorimotor_Neural_Engineering">Center for Sensorimotor Neural Engineering (CSNE)</a>
    in presenting early plans for developing a
    '<a target="_blank" href="https://community.arm.com/iot/embedded/b/embedded-blog/posts/arm-and-csne-team-up-to-develop-brain-implantable-chips?utm_source=Social&utm_medium=Organic&utm_campaign=IoT">brain implantable system-on-a-chip' (SoC)</a>.
    Rather than fabricating and subjecting patients to nightmare-ridden realities, the
    organisations are aiming to improve the quality of life to those with mental disorders
    such as <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_disease">Parkinson's</a>
    and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease">Alzheimer's disease</a>.
    The implants, if successful, should be useful in decoding and altering messages that the brain receives to
    correct the behaviour by the brain to help those suffering live better lives.
  </p>
 
  <p>
    Whilst a future reality of human augmentation may often be portrayed by the media
    as a misstep for the human race, each day there are behind-the-scenes progressions
    in medical fields which may, like the cardiac pacemaker, improve the lives of many.
