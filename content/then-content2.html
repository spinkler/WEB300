    It was in 1957 that <a target="_blank" href="http://pongmuseum.com/history/beginningsofcomputergames.php">'Tennis for Two'</a>
    forever changed the way people perceived computers as
    something more than complicated tools to solve equations or manage data. According to many,
    the game which simulated a side view of two people playing tennis was in fact considered one
    of the first recorded cases of a video game, and was showcased at an atomic research laboratory
    in a room of its own.

    As time progressed, so did transistor capabilities with niche 'home gaming consoles' being developed,
    and sold to the everyday consumer with hit titles such as <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong">Pong</a>.
    It was not up until the 1980s that gamers collectively changed their opinions from "Hey, that's kind of neat", to
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamestm.co.uk/features/why-super-mario-bros-was-a-game-changer/">"This is game changing!"</a>
    owing to the success of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendo.com/">Nintendo</a> &mdash; a
    company previously known for manufacturing playing cards that had now started producing genre changing video games such as
    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros."><span class="emphasize">Super Mario Bros.</span></a>
    and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda_(video_game)"><span class="emphasize">The Legend of Zelda</span></a>.
  </p>
 
  <p>
    From then, to the now present day, innovations in video games consoles have gone above and
    beyond from being a mere gimmick, to now offering some of the most vivid experiences that people
    can enjoy from the comfort of their own homes. Given that this rapid growth of video games has
    happened within the lifetime of some, it is understandable when the validity of comparing the medium
    to the likes of books and films may questioned regarding how much value they provide our society.
