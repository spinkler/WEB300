    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/528779/virtual-reality-market-size-worldwide/">make headway in the market</a>,
    users and game/simulator developers are looking at new ways to use digital technology
    to increase their immersion within a gaming environment with the possibilities
    to, as Matthew Schnipper says "Put on these goggles, go nowhere, and be transported anywhere".

    While VR is not a new concept, having its day in the late 80's and early 90's,
    modern hardware has observed a renewed vigor in VR possibilities. In particular,
    the usage for immersion and realism within flight simulators such as
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.x-plane.com/">Laminar Research's X-Plane 11</a> and
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prepar3d.com/">Lockheed Martin's Prepar3D</a>, are
    not only considered a recreational flight sim, but as an educational, training system.
  </p>

  <p>
    The key draw-card for flight simulators when used as training instruments for would-be
    pilots is to achieve realism, and gain a feel for flight, without the real-world costs
    of lessons or only having first hand flight experience to realise if flight is for them.
  </p>

  <p>
    With an <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_Rift">Oculus Rift</a> at the ready, as described in a
    <a target="_blank" href="https://vrflightworld.com/2017/11/19/vr-flight-simulation-why/">
    VR Flight World article</a>, a depth of realism was achieved through VR within X-Plane 11
    that allows physical head movement to look around the cockpit and experience flight,
    practice maneuvers, take-off and landings and to feel a part of the simulator as seen
    through the eyes of a real pilot.
  </p>

  <p>
    The question remains if current VR technologies can evolve to the point where the
    simulated environment is on par with the real world, and be an extension to living
    reality. Only time will tell.
