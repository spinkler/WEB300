    From the original <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)#Nokia_phones">Snake on Nokia 6110</a>
    mobile phones to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angry_Birds">Angry Birds</a> and
    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_Crush_Saga">Candy Crush</a> on today's smartphones,
    we have had access to some type of gaming media on the go for decades.

  <p>
    With the development of digital mobile technology from the black and white
    days of Snake to full-fledged gaming experiences with graphical quality of
    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation">Playstation</a>
    right in the palm of our hands, the definition of what a 'gamer'
    is has changed, along with the general gaming demographic.

    As smart phones have become a part of everyday life, with an
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1906/mobile-gaming/">
    increase in mobile gaming</a>, a dramatic shift in gaming demographics has seen more
    children, female, and older age groups reach for their mobile devices to
    indulge themselves in some pixel gaming goodness.
  </p>
  
  <p>                        
    With mobile games such as <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Go">Pokemon GO</a> and Candy Crush having
    <a target="_blank" href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/06/30/pokemon-go-passes-1-2-billion-in-revenue-and-752-million-downloads/">

    2.73 billion</a> downloads respectively on mobile platforms, the definition
    of who a 'gamer' is, has surely too shifted.

  <p>
    While mainstream gaming development studios may cater for a predominately-male
    18-25 demographic as described by
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamesparks.com/blog/the-average-gamer-how-the-demographics-have-shifted/">
    GameSparks.com</a> with the dismissive attitude of mobile gaming being "not real
    gaming" due to its casual nature, Pokemon Go and Candy Crush have proven that
    AAA games are not the only type of gaming media individuals have to consume
    in order to consider themselves too, <span class="emphasize">a gamer</span>.
