	  Ask an academic about their thoughts on the MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online game),
	  and they'll often give reasons beyond nostalgia or addictive gameplay as to why they
	  were, and still are such a big deal. It is after all, that the MMO changed the rules
	  around the activity of 'play' and how it is further defined. Previously academics
	  such as Johan Huizinga (1938) proposed several conditions to be met for 'play' to
	  emerge, and one of these was that participants were required to be physically situated
	  with one another.
	</p>
 
	<p>
	  This primitive activity of 'play' has been changed only within some of our lifetimes
	  with the earliest renditions of MMOs somewhat resembling MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons),
	  and later growing into the popular MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game).
	  For first time ever, gamers were enabled to engage in 'play' and communicate with others
	  in other geographical regions.
	</p>
 
	<p>
	  Notable early titles such as Ultima Online and Everquest placed the player in vivid
	  virtual worlds which were usually fantasy rich and based in medieval periods. This
	  social and deep approach to gaming was well received with MMORPGs as they continue to
	  grow in popularity and evolve alongside technological advances.
	</p>
 
	<p>
	  Upon skipping back to the present day, an observation may be that most modern video
	  games borrow from these earliest renditions in ways which work, or sometimes don't.
	  One thing is for sure, and that is that MMOs have forever changed the way that gamers
	  engage in 'play'.
