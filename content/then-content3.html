        <a class="emphasize" target="_blank" href="https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/">World of Warcraft (2004)</a> &mdash; The most popular MMORPG to date

	  Ask an academic about their thoughts on the 
	  <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game">MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online game)</a>,
	  and they'll often give reasons beyond nostalgia or addictive gameplay as to why they
	  were, and still are such a big deal. It is after all, that the MMO changed the rules
	  around the activity of 'play' and how it is further defined. Previously academics, such as
	  <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Huizinga">Johan Huizinga</a>
	  in his book, <a class="emphasize" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_Ludens">Homo Ludens (1938)</a>,
	  proposed several conditions to be met for 'play' to  emerge, and one of these was that
	  participants were required to be physically situated with one another.

        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyxFSZH-Xdw"><span class="emphasize">World of Warcraft's</span>
        player base would soar to dizzying heights</a>, with a subscriber count of
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20101007005648/en">over
          12 million by the end of its third expansion</a>.

    </div>
    
	<p>
	  This primitive activity of 'play' has been changed only within some of our lifetimes
	  with the earliest renditions of MMOs somewhat resembling
	  <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons)</a>,
	  and later growing into the popular MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game).
	  For first time ever, gamers were enabled to engage in 'play' and communicate with others
	  in other geographical regions.
	</p>
 
	<p>
	  Notable early titles such as
	  <a class="emphasize" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_Online">Ultima Online</a>
	  and <a class="emphasize" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EverQuest">Everquest</a>
	  placed the player in vivid virtual worlds which were usually fantasy rich and based in medieval periods.
	  This social and deep approach to gaming was well received with MMORPGs as they continue to
	  grow in popularity and evolve alongside technological advances.
	</p>
 
	<p>
	  Upon skipping back to the present day, an observation may be that most modern video
	  games borrow from these earliest renditions in ways which work, or sometimes don't.
	  One thing is for sure, and that is that MMOs have forever changed the way that gamers
	  engage in 'play'.
