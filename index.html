	      This Web Media Project examines the convergence of media over time, with a particular (but not sole)
	      focus on gaming technologies. It is designed in an asynchronous manner, allowing for a non-linear
	      experience, however a clear narrative will present itself if you choose a linear viewing experience instead.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      We also encourage our audience to start discussion on any points of interest using the comment section at the
	      bottom of each page. Do you remember what it was like back then? How is convergence affecting your life now?
	      Are you prepared for when convergence seeps into every facet of human life?

				<h2>Production Diary</h2>

			<hr />
			
			<div class="content-data">
			  <h3>Ty Scicluna</h3>
			  <h4>Weekly</h4>
			  <p>
			    Meetings were held on Discord twice per week, assuring our schedule was adhered to.
			    This allowed each team member to offer feedback and advice on others’ work, ensuring
			    that each member was part of the complete production while maintaining separate roles.
			    A specific schedule audit was conducted during Week 7 to highlight potential issues,
			    but deadlines were met without issue. The fundamental framework of our design allowed
			    individuals to work completely independently, and the whole team worked very well to
			    deliver a complete, punctual project.
			  </p>
			  <h4>Week 5</h4>
			  <p>
			    Implementation of this project began with establishing a git account to contain our
			    source code. This ensured logging changes to the code base while providing a means for
			    the team to access the code. Once set up the directory structure would be created and
			    pushed to git to offer a starting point, and we proceeded to choose our design.
			  </p>
			  <h4>Week 6</h4>
			  <p>
			    Implementation of navigation buttons and aesthetics began, offering a fundamental
			    structure to work with when implementing page animations and transitions.
			  </p>
			  <p>
			    With previous HTML and CSS experience, Javascript was completely missing from my
			    skill set. Javascript was necessary to provide a clean, smooth user experience, or
			    our site would lack narrative and direction, so research began.
			  </p>
			  <p>
			    Material design guidelines were researched, particularly for animation. These
			    animations offer a cohesive, natural, and intuitive experience, making the flow
			    of information obvious.
			  </p>
			  <h4>Week 7</h4>
			  <p>
			    After installing an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to keep track of code
			    implementation of Javascript began, but had issues. Initially an animation framework
			    was used. This proved tricky, and was ultimately unsuitable for our needs. It was
			    time to get my hands dirty and start building this from the ground up.
			  </p>
			  <p>
			    Learning Jquery was my goal, so I began by implementing a basic framework in HTML and CSS.
			    I have experience in many programming languages and with CSS animations so I had
			    some idea of what to expect. The first Javascript I implemented resolved the page
			    we were coming <span class="emphasize">from</span>, allowing me to determine which
			    page state to transition from, and hence, the beginning state of the next animation.
			  </p>
			  <h4>Week 8</h4>
			    <p>
			      After implementing transitions I encountered a glaring problem. When tested
			      remotely the slower speed prevented smooth transitions. Rendering subsequent
			      pages was incredibly obvious and broke the user experience, neglecting our fundamental
			      goals.
			    </p>
			    <p>
				  Back to the drawing board, I learned more about Javascript/Jquery, and how to
				  implement a proper SPA (Single Page Application). This required a major overhaul
				  of the code base. Luckily all of the referrer logic established earlier would carry
				  over. Dissatisfied with the colour scheme, this reimplementation also consisted of
				  assigning all the CSS colour definitions to variables so they could be freely altered.
				</p>			    
			  <h4>Week 9</h4>
			    <p>
			      With our SPA fully implemented and showcasing smooth transitions and navigation,
			      week 9 was all about polish. First, colour was given full attention. This was simple
			      thanks to the variables implemented earlier, so we iterated until we found something
			      suitable.
			    </p>
			    <p>
			      I reviewed the Material Design animation guidelines to polish delays and durations of
			      all the animations to offer the most cohesive experience possible, and image modals
			      were implemented, allowing users to view images in high resolution.
			    </p>
			    <p>
			      With the heavy lifting done, it was now simply a matter of importing and proof reading
			      the content, registering DNS, uploading, and testing our code.
			    </p>

			  <h3>Nathan Barnes</h3>
			  <h4>Week 5</h4>
			  <p>
			    During the first production week, we met via Discord to discuss our proposed WMP as
			    set during the draft phase, and all assigned duties were understood before we began our
			    work. I then conducted preliminary research into the articles we wanted to present on the
			    website that would be our WMP. My role, inclusive of writing articles, editing and
			    formatting with addition of acquiring attributable, quotes and images, I had to ensure
			    all content was easily accessible and transferable from my copy to the website. Therefore,
			    I utilised the Google Suite I had shared with the team during the draft phase to allow
			    team members the opportunity to provide feedback, access content and see individual progress.
			  </p>
			  <h4>Week 6</h4>
			  <p>
			    For this week, I focused on additional article research and compiled the research I had
			    into drafts based upon each of our nine set topics. I sourced information via Google, feeling
			    it proved efficient in locating the information required to help form the article I had
			    selected to write. Although I have experience in, and enjoy the task of creative writing,
			    I had minor difficulties keeping to the word limit we, as a team, set for each article to
			    ensure we met the user experience of 10-minutes or less. I overcame this by writing in my
			    usual style, and applying heavy editing skills, which made for concise articles as planned.
			  </p>
			  <h4>Week 7</h4>
			  <p>
			    This week I was heavily focused on content development for the website. I began editing my
			    draft articles, formatting for easy website transference, implementing breakout quotes
			    and images with attribution and then finalising the article content. This ensured it was
			    a presentable web standard and the standard we as a team were striving for and found
			    acceptable. In addition, being midway into the WMP we as a team took time to assess and
			    ensure we were meeting our set deadlines and assigned duties. We found this to be a
			    constructive task as it identified we were an effective team that worked well together,
			    and were effective communicators capable of achieving our set goal.
			  </p>
			  <h4>Week 8</h4>
			  <p>
			    This week I began by focusing on articles written by other team members and suggesting
			    edits and feedback I felt applicable. During this week, I was also able to offer feedback
			    to the current website development, which afforded a learning opportunity, as I was able
			    to learn a small amount of Javascript, and Jquery that Ty was implementing into our WMP.
			    Given my entry-level understanding of HTML and CSS, it was of interest to me to see the
			    code behind our WMP that made it function, which afforded me a learning experience outside
			    of my defined skill set and knowledge.
			  </p>
			  <h4>Week 9</h4>
			  <p>
			    During the last week of production, final touches to the WMP ensured our content met the
			    requirements of a 10-minute or under viewing experience. I wrote the final article assigned
			    to me, as per our production schedule in addition to raising the question of copyright and
			    creative commons (CC) usage on DB. The matter of copyright and CC I discussed with the team
			    as I felt it of great importance given our use of images and materials not of our own creation,
			    which therefore, I felt required careful consideration. In addition, I compiled a reference
			    list for all used quotes, images and video files used within all articles, adhering to required
			    referencing style.
			  </p>
			  			 
			  <hr />
			  
			  <h3>Matt Simpson</h3>
			  <h4>Week 5</h4>
			  <p>
			    The first week of production has been light in actual content creation and instead,
			    much of individual effort was dedicated into going over the brief and aligning my thoughts
			    to where each team member was headed for the next couple of weeks as per suggested by the
			    production schedule. During the first of our weekly meetings, I helped to set up some of
			    the foundations of WMP creation regarding shared documents, templates and discussed who
			    specifically was writing which article. Nathan and I also evaluated design mock-ups that
			    Ty had created and suggested feedback and direction for future work in the layout of the WMP.
			  </p>
			  <h4>Week 6</h4>
			  <p>
			    In this week of production, I attempted to put much of my focus on building a partnership
			    with Ty as my role required me to assist in some of the web development aspects of the WMP.
			    I created a GitHub account to collaborate, and provide feedback to Ty, in practice however,
			    we found it much more productive to allow him to control all coding as modifying or changing
			    existing code could create confusion. Instead, I allocated this saved time into researching
			    ways in which we could implement a ‘comments’ feature into the articles, eventually settling
			    on and suggesting the Facebook comments plugin.
			  </p>
			  <h4>Week 7</h4>
			  <p>
			    This week I carried out bulk, general background research into the chosen areas of content
			    production as predetermined by my role. This process required me to read, and gather multiple
			    articles on topics that we have previously agreed upon to write about. With this information
			    freshly in mind, I created the first article in the blog &mdash; "An Unlikely Resurrection for the
			    Arcade", and requested Nathan to provide feedback on the work in Google Docs. This article took
			    more time to finalise than originally planned in the production schedule as I was aiming to use
			    the standards of it as a benchmark for preceding work.
			  </p>
			  <h4>Week 8</h4>
			  <p>
			    Immediately upon receiving detailed feedback from Nathan for my article, I started writing and
			    further published two more articles &mdash; "Always-Online", and "The Historical Significance
			    of the MMO" using the sources found in the previous week. Alike to my previous content, these
			    were submitted to Google Docs for review by Nathan. I found that my previous research, and
			    previous efforts in writing the first article had set the groundwork to delivering these two
			    articles in quick succession.
			  </p>
			  <h4>Week 9</h4>
			  <p>
			    The final week revealed itself to be slightly different to what I had planned as there were
			    major topic changes to the last two articles, the reason being that the initially planned
			    articles had too much in common to what was already written by myself and Nathan. This meant
			    I had to allocate more time earlier in the week to have these articles properly researched,
			    written and reviewed from the ground up. Finally, I could help the team in adding to the final
			    touches to the presentation which included testing the website, suggesting several references
			    to content and providing general feedback to the design to Ty before he delivered the final
			    upload of our WMP.
